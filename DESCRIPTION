Description: This R package contains a set of functions to calculate niche breadth (or resource selectivity) from resource utilisation and resource trait data. Like Levin's nice breadth index, nicheDIM incorporates both the number of resources utilised by an organism, and the distribution of utilisation across these resources. However, nicheDIM also incorporates the relatedness or similarity between resources in any quantifiable dimension to generate a more ecologically realistic measure of niche breadth, while maintaining the conceptual simplicity and comparability of Levin's original index.
